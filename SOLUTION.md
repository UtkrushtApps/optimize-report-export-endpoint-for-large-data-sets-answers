# Solution Steps

1. 1. Set up a FastAPI app in 'main.py'.

2. 2. Implement an asynchronous generator function (get_large_dataset) that yields chunks of data as lists of dictionaries, simulating database pagination/streaming (in real use, connect to your async DB).

3. 3. Define another asynchronous generator (csv_chunk_generator_async) that uses csv.DictWriter to write each chunk to an in-memory string buffer, yielding encoded bytes per chunk, writing the header only once.

4. 4. Implement the /export-report endpoint using FastAPI's StreamingResponse, passing the async CSV generator as the body, setting the correct content-disposition header for file download.

5. 5. Allow chunk_size and total_rows as query parameters to tune data size/chunk size; ensure validations are set so users cannot request extremes that may break performance.

6. 6. (Optionally, for advanced/huge-scale flows, background tasks could be expanded to enqueue export jobs and notify users when ready, but for this task we provide direct streaming efficient enough for very large outputs.)

7. 7. Add a README.md explaining features, usage, and customization points.
